# AutoMap
Make a pseudo random rectangular map with a command line, for simple 2D oriented gameplay video games.

Command line: 

*AutoMap.exe /man* (or any too small number of argument, included zero!) for help.

*AutoMap.exe map.txt 5 "A"=1 "B"=2 "C"=3 "D"=4 "E"=5 "F"=5* for usual usage, for example.

Today, not compatible with hi-end quality maps, like maps done with Tiled Map Editor.
